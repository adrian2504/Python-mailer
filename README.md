# Python-mailer

Using python to generate automatic mail and mail it to its recipients.
Once we define our subject and body, our body can contain images or pdf and much more.

We can send mails to all respective recipients by reading from an excel file.

In this I customized my mailer to select a certificate pdf from a folder based on the cirrent name in the excel sheet, add the name from the sheet in the body of the sender and mail it.

IMPORTANT make sure that you have enabled the option to set less secure app to ON
