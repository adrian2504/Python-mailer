# Python-mailer

Using python to generate automatic mail and mail it to its recipients.  
Once we define our subject and body, our body can contain images or pdf and much more.

We can send mails to all respective recipients by reading from an `excel` file.

In this I customized my mailer to select a certificate pdf from a folder based on the current name in the excel sheet, add the name from the sheet in the body of the sender and mail it.

**Make sure that you have enabled the option in your gmail security setting the set less secure app feature to ON.**  
By default this remains `OFF`, *so you need to activate* it inorder to perform your smtp transfer. ðŸ™‚
